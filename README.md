# slect

## Overview
slect is a web interface for Server/VPS. This project was created as a part of my learning journey with Golang and Node.js. It helped me understand how the Linux user system works. The frontend is built using Node.js and the backend is built using Golang. It also features a web terminal implemented using sockets in Golang. Additionally, I used the C language for accessing the Linux kernel API in Golang.

## Features
- Web Interface: Manage your Server/VPS through a user-friendly web interface.
- Web Terminal: Access your server directly from the web using the built-in terminal.
